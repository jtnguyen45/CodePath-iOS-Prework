## App Brainstorming
These are my favorite apps and what I like about each of them:
+ Instagram
  + A lot of custom tools when posting stories
  + You can send screen decorations/events to your friends in direct messages
+ Tiktok
  + Video recording and editing abilities
  + Being able to organize your favorite tiktoks in folders
  + Smooth scrolling of tiktoks and comments section
+ Snapchat
  + Keeps track of your best friends and snap streak
  + Fun face filters

An idea for an app I would like to implement would be a version of the board game Guess Who? You would be able to import your own pictures or pick from the pre-made images and play Guess Who? with your friends. For example, if you wanted to play Guess Who? with the cast of Game of Thrones, there would be a pre-made board of each character or you would be able to import your own images. I would want to implement an in game chat so you are able to communicate with the other player. I would also like to implement a scoreboard to keep track of the amount of times you won or lost against your friend.

## Notes

The main challenge that I encountered while making this app was familiarizing myself with xCode's UI and navigating to the correct tabs.
